"""Base class for all Prefab actions.

Every action type inherits from `Action`, which provides the
`on_success` and `on_error` lifecycle callbacks. These let you chain
reactions to action outcomes without writing custom logic:

    CallTool("save",
        on_success=ShowToast("Saved!"),
        on_error=ShowToast("Save failed", variant="error"),
    )

Callbacks can themselves have callbacks (recursive), and the renderer
enforces a depth limit to prevent infinite loops. When actions compose
as a list, the first error short-circuits the chain — the failing action's
`on_error` runs, then execution stops.
